We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.F-2Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Impairment Assessments of Real Estate InvestmentsAs described in Notes 2, 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s real estate investments net carrying value was $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2024. Management regularly monitors events and changes in circumstances, including investment operating performance and general market conditions, that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate investments may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate investments may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability by estimating whether the Company will recover the carrying value of its real estate investments through the undiscounted future cash flows and the eventual disposition of the investment. The undiscounted future cash flows used to assess recoverability are based on several assumptions and are probability-weighted based on the Company’s best estimates as of the date of evaluation. These assumptions include, among others, market rent, revenue and expense growth rates, absorption period, stabilized occupancy, holding period, market capitalization rates, and estimated market values based on analysis of letters of intent, purchase and sale agreements and comparable sales and other local and national industry market data. If, based on this analysis, the Company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of its real estate investments, the Company would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of its real estate investments.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessments of real estate investments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in (a) identifying events and changes in circumstances that are indicators of impairment related to the performance of the investment and market conditions and (b) developing the undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the recoverability assessment of real estate investments with potential impairment and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to (a) management’s identification of events or changes in circumstances related to the performance of the investment and market conditions and (b) management’s probability weightings and assumptions used in the undiscounted future cash flows related to market rent, revenue and expense growth rates, absorption period, stabilized occupancy, holding period and market capitalization rates (collectively referred to as the “significant assumptions”).Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s impairment assessments of investments in real estate properties, including controls over management’s (a) identification of events and changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amounts of the real estate investments may not be recoverable and (b) recoverability assessment of real estate investments with potential impairment. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for (a) identifying events and changes in circumstances that are indicators of impairment and (b) assessing the recoverability of the real estate investments with potential impairments, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the undiscounted cash flow models and probability weightings used in the recoverability assessment process, (iii) testing the completeness, accuracy, relevance and reliability of the underlying data used in the undiscounted cash flow models, (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment of events and changes in circumstances that are indicators of impairment related to performance of the investment and general market conditions indicating that the carrying amounts of its real estate investments may not be recoverable by considering the consistency with the current and past performance of the real estate investment and the consistency with external market and industry data, and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in the undiscounted future cash flows of real estate investments with potential impairment by considering the consistency of the significant assumptions with the current and past performance of the real estate investments, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether these significant assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Irvine, CaliforniaFebruary 19, 2025 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2010.F-3SABRA HEALTH CARE REIT, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(dollars in thousands, except per share data) December 31,20242023AssetsReal estate investments, net of accumulated depreciation of $1,102,030 and $1,021,086 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively$4,513,734 $4,617,261 Loans receivable and other investments, net442,584 420,624 Investment in unconsolidated joint ventures121,803 136,843 Cash and cash equivalents60,468 41,285 Restricted cash5,871 5,434 Lease intangible assets, net27,464 30,897 Accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, net131,755 133,806 Total assets$5,303,679 $5,386,150 LiabilitiesSecured debt, net$45,316 $47,301 Revolving credit facility106,554 94,429 Term loans, net529,753 537,120 Senior unsecured notes, net1,736,025 1,735,253 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities117,896 136,981 Lease intangible liabilities, net26,847 32,532 Total liabilities2,562,391 2,583,616 Commitments and contingencies (Note 16)EquityPreferred stock, $0.01 par value;

(“Sabra” or the “Company”) was incorporated on May 10, 2010 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. (“Sun”) and commenced operations on November 15, 2010 following Sabra’s separation from Sun. Sabra elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with the filing of its United States (“U.S.”) federal income tax return for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2011. Sabra believes that it has been organized and operated, and it intends to continue to operate, in a manner to qualify as a REIT. Sabra’s primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning real estate property to be leased to third-party tenants in the healthcare sector. Sabra primarily generates revenues by leasing properties to tenants throughout the U.S. and Canada. Sabra owns substantially all of its assets and properties and conducts its operations through Sabra Health Care Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), of which Sabra is the sole general partner and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sabra is currently the only limited partner, or by subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The Company’s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of skilled nursing/transitional care facilities, senior housing communities (“Senior Housing - Leased”), behavioral health facilities and specialty hospitals and other facilities, in each case leased to tenants who are responsible for the operations of these facilities; senior housing communities operated by third-party property managers pursuant to property management agreements (“Senior Housing - Managed”); investments in joint ventures; investments in loans receivable; and preferred equity investments. 2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sabra and its wholly owned subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the Company to identify entities for which control is achieved through voting rights or other means and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). A VIE is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity’s activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity’s activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. If the Company were determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the Company would consolidate investments in the VIE. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.The Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the entity. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2024, the Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of any VIEs.As it relates to investments in loans, in addition to the Company’s assessment of VIEs and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of those VIEs, the Company evaluates the loan terms and other pertinent facts to determine whether the loan investment should be accounted for as a loan or as a real estate joint venture. If an investment has the characteristics of a real estate joint venture, including if the Company participates in the majority of the borrower’s expected residual profit, the Company would account for the investment as an investment in a real estate joint venture and not as a loan investment. Expected residual profit is defined as the amount of profit, whether called interest or another name, such as an equity kicker, above a reasonable amount of interest and fees expected to be earned by a lender. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, none of the Company’s investments in loans were accounted for as real estate joint ventures.F-10As it relates to investments in joint ventures, the Company assesses any partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the partnership by any single partner. The Company also applies this guidance to managing member interests in limited liability companies. The Company reassesses its determination of which entity controls the joint venture if: there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of any partners or members, the general partner or managing member increases or decreases its ownership interests, or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding ownership interests. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s determination of which entity controls its investments in joint ventures has not changed as a result of any reassessment.Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Real Estate Investments and Rental Revenue RecognitionReal Estate Acquisition ValuationAll assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition of real estate accounted for as a business combination are measured at their acquisition date fair values. For acquisitions of real estate accounted for as an asset acquisition, the fair value of consideration transferred by the Company (including transaction costs) is allocated to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. The acquisition value of land, building and improvements are included in real estate investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The acquisition value of above market lease, tenant origination and absorption costs and tenant relationship intangible assets is included in lease intangible assets, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The acquisition value of below market lease intangible liabilities is included in lease intangible liabilities, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Acquisition costs associated with real estate acquisitions deemed asset acquisitions are capitalized, and costs associated with real estate acquisitions deemed business combinations are expensed as incurred. Restructuring costs that do not meet the definition of a liability at the acquisition date are expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date.Estimates of the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities require the Company to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The Company makes its best estimate based on the Company’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease. The use of inappropriate assumptions would result in an incorrect valuation of the Company’s acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities, which would impact the amount of the Company’s net income.Depreciation and Amortization Real estate costs related to the acquisition and improvement of properties are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the expected useful life of the asset and the remaining lease term of any property subject to a ground lease. Tenant improvements are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the expected useful life of the asset and the remaining lease term. Depreciation is discontinued when a property is identified as held for sale. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset. The Company considers the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life. Depreciation of real estate assets and amortization of tenant origination and absorption costs and tenant relationship lease intangibles are included in depreciation and amortization on the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss). Amortization of above and below market lease intangibles is included in rental income on the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss). The Company anticipates the estimated useful lives of its assets by class to be generally as follows: land improvements, 15 to 20 years; buildings and building improvements, five to 40 years; and furniture and equipment, three to 10 years. Intangibles are generally amortized over the remaining noncancellable lease terms, with tenant relationship intangible amortization periods including extension periods.Impairment of Real Estate Investments The Company regularly monitors events and changes in circumstances, including investment operating performance and general market conditions, that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate investments may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate investments may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability by estimating whether the Company will recover the carrying value of its real estate investments through the undiscounted future cash flows and the eventual disposition of the investment. In some instances, there may be various potential outcomes for an investment and its potential undiscounted future cash flows. In these instances, the F-11undiscounted future cash flows models used to assess recoverability are based on several assumptions and are probability-weighted based on the Company’s best estimates as of the date of evaluation. These assumptions include, among others, market rent, revenue and expense growth rates, absorption period, stabilized occupancy, holding period, market capitalization rates, and estimated market values based on analysis of letters of intent, purchase and sale agreements, and comparable sales and other local and national industry market data. When discounted cash flow is used to determine fair value, a discount rate assumption is also used. The assumptions are generally based on management’s experience in its local real estate markets, and the effects of current market conditions, which are subject to economic and market uncertainties. If, based on this analysis, the Company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of its real estate investments, the Company would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of its real estate investments. The Company determines estimated fair value based primarily upon (i) estimated sale prices from signed contracts or letters of intent from third-party offers, (ii) discounted cash flow models of the investment over its remaining hold period, (iii) third-party appraisals and (iv) comparable sales and other local and national industry market data.Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes rental revenue from tenants, including rental abatements, lease incentives and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases when it is probable that substantially all rents over the life of a lease are collectible. Certain of the Company’s leases provide for contingent rents equal to a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the applicable base amount or other threshold.The Company assesses the collectability of rents on a lease-by-lease basis, and in doing so, considers such things as historical bad debts, tenant creditworthiness, current economic trends, facility operating performance, lease structure, credit enhancements (including guarantees), current developments relevant to a tenant’s business specifically and to its business category generally, and changes in tenants’ payment patterns. The Company’s assessment includes an estimation of a tenant’s ability to fulfill all of its rental obligations over the remaining lease term. In addition, with respect to tenants in bankruptcy, management makes estimates of the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims in assessing the estimated collectability of the related receivable. If at any time the Company cannot determine that it is probable that substantially all rents over the life of a lease are collectible, rental revenue will be recognized only to the extent of payments received, and all receivables associated with the lease will be written off irrespective of amounts expected to be collectible. Any recoveries of these amounts will be recorded in future periods upon receipt of payment. Write-offs of receivables and any recoveries of previously written-off receivables are recorded as adjustments to rental revenue.Revenue from resident fees and services is recorded monthly as services are provided and includes resident room and care charges, ancillary services charges and other resident charges. Government GrantsBy analogy to International Accounting Standards 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, government assistance provided to the Company in the form of an income grant, which is not related to long-lived assets and is not required to be repaid, is recognized as grant income when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Company will comply with any conditions associated with the grant. Additionally, grants are recognized over the periods in which the Company recognizes the qualifying expenses and/or lost income for which the grants are intended to compensate. As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the amount of qualifying expenditures exceeded amounts recognized under The Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act and other programs, and the Company had complied with all grant conditions. Accordingly, during each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $0.1 million of grants in resident fees and services, and during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $3.6 million of grants in loss from unconsolidated joint ventures in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss). No grants were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024.Casualty Gains and LossesIncome resulting from insurance recoveries of property damage or business interruption losses is recognized when proceeds are received or contingencies related to the insurance recoveries are resolved.Assets Held for Sale, Dispositions and Discontinued OperationsThe Company generally considers real estate to be “held for sale” when the following criteria are met: (i) management commits to a plan to sell the property, (ii) the property is available for sale immediately, (iii) the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, (iv) the sale of the property within one year is considered probable and (v) significant changes to the plan to sell are not expected. Real estate that is held for sale and its F-12related assets are classified as assets held for sale and are included in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Secured indebtedness and other liabilities related to real estate held for sale are classified as liabilities related to assets held for sale and are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Real estate classified as held for sale is no longer depreciated and is reported at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value less es
